# elgentos EasyAttributes

Batch add attribute options and drag & drop to rearrange their order!

With this extension it is possible to add high volumes of attribute options to an attribute at once. For example, if you have an Excel file with all the brands you sell in your shop you can easily paste this list in the textarea and add them all at once.

Furthermore, it is now very easy to rearrange the order of the attributes; grab the up & down arrows and drag it up or down to effortlessly adjust the order.
